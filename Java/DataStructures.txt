Arrays. sort uses dual-pivot Quicksort on primitives. It offers O(n log(n)) performance and is typically faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations.
However, it uses a stable, adaptive, iterative implementation of mergesort algorithm for Array of Objects.

In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client 
and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.

Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.

View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.

Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
